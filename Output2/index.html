<h1>My First Web Page</h1>

<h2>Headings Are Great Fun</h2>

<p>
    This is my <b>first paragraph</b> in my new webpage. This is going to be great.
    I am so excited I can hardly contain <b>myself</b>. Don't you just love paragraphs?
    I find them very useful.
</p>

<h2>Web Pages Are Exciting Too</h2>

<p>
    Yes, that's right â€“ web pages can be a lot of fun. Learning how to create web pages is 
    <b>easy</b> and <b>entertaining</b>. This is my second <i>paragraph</i>. I hope you like it.
